     *
     * The Network object created should have the stops, routes, and vehicles
     * contained in the given file.
     * @param filename The name of the file to load the network from.
     * @throws IOException If any IO exceptions occur whilst trying to read from
     *         the file, or if the filename is null.
     * @throws TransportFormatException
     *         1. If any of the lines representing stops, routes, or vehicles
     *            are incorrectly formatted according to their respective decode
     *            methods (i.e. if their decode method throws an exception).

     *            (i.e. cannot be parsed).
     *         3. If the {number_of_stops} does not match the actual number of
     *            lines representing stops present. This also applies to
     *            {number_of_routes} and {number_of_vehicles}.

     *            (the file may end with a single newline character, but there
     *            may not be multiple blank lines at the end of the file).
