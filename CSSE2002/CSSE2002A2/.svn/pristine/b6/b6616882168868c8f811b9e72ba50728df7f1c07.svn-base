     * representation of a Route, and {typeN,idN,capacityN,routeNumber,extra} is
     * the encode() representation of a PublicTransport.
     *
     * For example:
     * 4
     * stop0:0:1
     * stop1:-1:0
     * stop2:4:2
     * stop3:2:-8
     * 2
     * train,red,1:stop0|stop2|stop1
     * bus,blue,2:stop1|stop3|stop0
     * 3
     * train,123,30,1,2
     * train,42,60,1,3
     * bus,412,20,2,ABC123
     * The Network object created should have the stops, routes, and vehicles
     * contained in the given file.
     * @param filename The name of the file to load the network from.
     * @throws IOException If any IO exceptions occur whilst trying to read from
     *         the file, or if the filename is null.
     * @throws TransportFormatException
     *         1. If any of the lines representing stops, routes, or vehicles
     *            are incorrectly formatted according to their respective decode
     *            methods (i.e. if their decode method throws an exception).
     *         2. If any of the integers are incorrectly formatted
     *            (i.e. cannot be parsed).
     *         3. If the {number_of_stops} does not match the actual number of
     *            lines representing stops present. This also applies to
     *            {number_of_routes} and {number_of_vehicles}.
     *         4. If there are any extra lines present in the file
     *            (the file may end with a single newline character, but there
     *            may not be multiple blank lines at the end of the file).
     *         5. If any other formatting issues are encountered whilst parsing
     *            the file.
